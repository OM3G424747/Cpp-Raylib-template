# C++ Raylib template
## Basic template and set up for Raylib projects using C++

Before using the template, I recommend downloading and installing <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/download/3.7.0/raylib_installer_v370.mingw.exe">Raylib version 3.7</a>.

You can also download and view other versions <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases">here</a>.
However, the workspace for this template is currently configured to work with 3.7.

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>
In order for this workspace to work as intended, it's important to install Raylib on your "C" drive's root directory.
Any changes to where you install Ralib will result in errors when trying to compile your work.

To fix this, you will need to change the directories being referred to by the ".json" files in the "<a href="https://github.com/OM3G424747/Cpp-Raylib-template/tree/main/vscode_raylib_template/.vscode">.vscode"</a> directory.
